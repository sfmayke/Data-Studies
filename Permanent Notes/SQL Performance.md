### SQL Performance

>How performant you is your query?
>Can be measured using `EXPLAIN` and/or integrated views on SQL editors.
>
>Many factors may affect the performance of you query, some you have control over... some you don't.

You control:
- Aggregations
- Joins
- Table size

You don't control:
- Concurrent queries ( Queries running at the same time as yours )
- The database performance optimization ( largely based on the database architecture itself )
