## Collation
---
>In a database, "collation" refers to a set of <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">rules that define how characters are sorted and compared</mark>, essentially determining the order in which text data is arranged based on language-specific considerations like case sensitivity, accent marks, and character ordering, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">allowing for accurate sorting and comparison across different languages and alphabets</mark> within a database system.

###### Example:

 If you set a database collation to "Latin1_General_CI_AS" (case-insensitive, accent-sensitive), then "café" and "Cafe" would be considered the same when sorting, but "café" would be different from "cafet" due to the accent.
